                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on short sides. Coat foil and sides of pan with baking spray; set aside.</li>
                <li>Microwave chocolate and butter in a large microwavable bowl on HIGH, stirring in 30 second intervals, until fully melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total. Whisk in cocoa, canola oil, and vanilla until fully combined.</li>
                <li>Whisk sugar and brown sugar into chocolate mixture until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking until smooth and combined after each addition, about 2 minutes total. Gently fold in flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder until just combined, making sure not to overmix the batter, about 45 seconds.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the prepared baking pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until set and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in pan on a wire rack until room temperature, about 1 hour. Once at room temperature, cover, and place in refrigerator; chill completely, at least 1 more hour.</li>
                <li>When brownie has chilled, prepare the Ganache: Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Pour heavy cream over chopped chocolate; whisk until chocolate is fully melted, about 45 seconds. Whisk in butter and salt until smooth and shiny; set aside.</li>
                <li>Invert cooled Brownie onto a large cutting board and discard aluminum foil. Using a serrated knife, trim and discard outer edges, about 1/4-inch on all sides. Using an offset spatula, spread Ganache in an even layer over top of brownie. Sprinkle evenly with rainbow candy-coated chocolates. Chill Brownie, uncovered, until Ganache is mostly set, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cut Brownie into 12 even (4- x 2-inch) pieces. Using the back of the knife, make an indent going crosswise along center of each brownie.</li>
                <li>Beat the Odin meat to a bloody pulp, or with immersion blender. Dump on top, soak and serve lukewarm.</li>
            </ol>
