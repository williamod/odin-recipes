The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with using Git, and
publishing projects to Github.

The project itself is a series of simple webpages containing simple recipes.
While the pages themselves are nothing impressive to look at, I think we all know its really about the friends we learned along the way.











I have borrowed text and images from the following websites. I do not claim them to be my own, as this project was purely for my own personal educational purposes:
