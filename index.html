        <h2> This title begs the question, are these recipes belonging <em>to</em> Odin? Its very possible he has an ecclectic understanding of cuizine, after all. 
            Or perhaps it is a collection of recipes <em>for</em> Odin, a sort of list of his favorites, as it were. 
            Or rather still, maybe it is a series of recipies of which <em>Odin himself</em> is apart! In any case, voila! </h2>
